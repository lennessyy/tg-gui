== Change a configuration parameter
:experimental:

Change the value in the input field of the corresponding configuration, and then click btn:[Apply], and then click btn:[OK] to confirm the change.

Once you confirm, the {server-name} server will restart to apply the changes, which will usually take several seconds.
You will be notified after the changes are applied.

If you are unsure about the changes you made before applying them, you can click the btn:[Discard] button to discard them.
If you changed the value of the parameter from the backend with `gadmin` since loading the page, you can click the refresh button in the upper right corner of the page to retrieve the current value.
