Choose one single log file by clicking on it, and the content will be shown in the display panel. The title will show the machine id and the path of the opened log file. To the very right, there is a download button  image:download-log-btn.png[]  for downloading the selected log file. Loaded log lines will add to the end of the file (the latest log content) and the system will keep pulling to update the log.

[CAUTION]
====
Note that it displays up to 32 MB of the log file before the latest line of the chosen log file. If users want to read the entire log file, users need to download the file.

== Search logs

image:search-panel.png[image]

In the search panel, a user needs to provide the following three pieces of information:

* Pattern
* Node
* Component

Without at a pattern and at least one node and one component, the search will not be performed.

Use the expand or collapse buttons for more space to view the log content, if necessary. image:collapse-btn.png[image]image:expand-btn.png[image]

The title of each search result contains the machine id, the file path
and the number of lines of content which match the pattern. The detailed
log line content will also be shown:

Clicking on a single search result will show the log content in the display panel and highlight the matching log line.
