== Open a log file from the file directory

In the file directory panel, all machines will be listed in a tree structure. Click a machine ID to show the components, and click again to show log files and folders.

Choose one single log file by clicking on it, and the content will be shown in the display panel.
The title will show the machine ID and the path of the opened log file. To the right, there is a download button image:download-log-btn.png[] for downloading the selected log file.
Loaded log lines will add to the end of the file (the latest log content) and the system will keep pulling to update the log.

[CAUTION]
====
Note that the display panel will only show the tail end of the chosen log file, up to 32 MB. If you wish to read the entire log file, download the file.

== Search logs

If your browser window is wide, you will see the search panel at the top.

If your browser window is narrow, the search panel collapsed. Click the image:search-btn.png[image] button to open it.

In the search panel, you need to provide the following three pieces of information:

* Pattern
* Node
* Component

Without a pattern and at least one node and one component, the search will not be performed.

Use the expand image:expand-btn.png[image] or collapse image:collapse-btn.png[image] buttons for more space to view the log content, if necessary.

The title of each search result contains the machine ID, the file path
and the number of lines of content which match the pattern. The detailed
log line content will also be shown:

Clicking on a single search result will show the log content in the display panel and highlight the matching log line.

== Read-Only Access to Logs

To streamline the debugging and optimization process, *read-only access to logs* has been introduced for application developers. This feature allows developers to independently view and monitor logs through *GraphStudio* or the *TigerGraph Cloud Portal* without requiring sysadmin intervention.

=== Privileges

==== APP_ACCESS_LOG Privilege
The `APP_ACCESS_LOG` privilege provides *global access* to logs for authorized users.
* *Scope:* Global
* *Default Roles:* Assigned to `superuser` and `globaldesigner` roles by default.
* *Purpose:* Grants access to view logs across all environments (on-prem and cloud).

==== READ_LOG Privilege
The `READ_LOG` privilege ensures *read-only access* to logs, preventing modifications while enabling secure monitoring and debugging.

=== Access Points

Users with the appropriate privileges can access logs through *GraphStudio* or the *TigerGraph Cloud Portal*:
1. *Log Viewing:* Access real-time updates for GSQL query logs and system logs.
2. *Search Capabilities:* Use the search panel to filter logs by patterns, nodes, and components.
3. *Download Options:* Download logs for offline analysis if needed.

[NOTE]
====
* These tools are designed to provide developers with the ability to debug, optimize queries, and monitor system health independently, reducing dependency on sysadmins.
* Logs are dynamically updated in real time, ensuring developers can monitor the system and identify issues promptly.
* The access provided is strictly *read-only*, maintaining system security and log integrity.
