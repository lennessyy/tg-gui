= Upgrade TigerGraph Suite
:experimental:

As part of our ongoing efforts to enhance the user experience for TigerGraph Tools, we need to implement an upgrade feature that allows users to easily upgrade their Tools installation.
The upgrade process should provide two options: clicking a button to upgrade the Tools directly or downloading the latest Tools package from our website and installing it through the Admin Portal UI.

== Check and Download

Latest Package Check:
Implement a mechanism that periodically checks for the availability of the latest Tools package.
The check should be performed either on-demand when users click the "Upgrade" button or automatically at regular intervals.
The system should retrieve information about the latest package version from a designated source (e.g., our website or a version control system).
Upgrade Prompt:
If an upgrade is available, display a message window to notify users about the new version.
The prompt should include information about the latest package version, release notes, and any significant improvements or bug fixes.
Users should have the option to proceed with the upgrade or dismiss the prompt.


== Manual Download

Manual Package Download and Installation:
Provide users with the ability to manually download the latest Tools package from our website.
Users should be able to access the download link on TigerGraphâ€™s official site.
Implement a validation mechanism during the installation process to ensure that the downloaded package is the correct version.
Upgrade Process:
If users choose to proceed with the upgrade, the system should guide them through the installation process.
During the installation, validate that the package version matches the expected version to prevent any potential issues or conflicts.

Error Handling:
Implement robust error-handling mechanisms throughout the upgrade process.
Inform users of any errors or conflicts that occur during the upgrade and provide clear instructions on how to resolve them.

Provide support resources, such as FAQs or a knowledge base, to assist users with any questions or issues they may encounter during the upgrade process.
