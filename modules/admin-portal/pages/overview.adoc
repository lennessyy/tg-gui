== Log On

Admin Portal and GraphStudio share the same port (14240). If you are logged in to one of the servers for your TigerGraph system, you can use `localhost` for your server IP address. The Admin Portal is on the admin page:

[source,http]
----
http://<tigergraph_server_ip_address>:14240/admin/
----

If user authentication has been enabled, users need to log in to access the Admin Portal.

If you are already at GraphStudio, click the btn:[Admin] button at the right end of the top menu bar to navigate to Admin Portal.

== Page Layout

The Admin Portal v3.1 has three pages: Dashboard, Monitor, and Management. All the pages share the same Header, and Navigation Menu.

[NOTE]
====
The layout of the Admin Portal is responsive to screen size.  The layout will automatically adjust for devices with small screens like phones and tablets.

$ gadmin config set GUI.ClientIdleTimeSec[timeout]
