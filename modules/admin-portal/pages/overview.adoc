== Log On

Admin Portal and GraphStudio share the same port (14240). If you are logged in to one of the servers for your TigerGraph system, you can use `localhost` for your server IP address. The Admin Portal is on the admin page:

[source,http]
----
http://<tigergraph_server_ip_address>:14240/admin/
----

If user authentication has been enabled, users need to log in to access the Admin Portal.

If you are already at GraphStudio, click the nine-dot TigerGraph Suite button in the top menu bar to navigate to Admin Portal.

== Design controls

The user menu is accessible from the User icon image:account_btn.png[] in the header.

You can navigate to GraphStudio by clicking on the btn:[GraphStudio] button in the upper right corner.

== Session Timeout

Admin Portal has a default session timeout of 1 week. If, during this time, the user has no interaction with the page, the session will expire and the user will be logged out automatically. The timeout can be configured with:

[source,bash]
----
$ gadmin config set GUI.ClientIdleTimeSec[timeout]
----
