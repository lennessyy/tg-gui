=== Select nodes and provide file path

You can select a specific machine in the cluster to download the output file from. By default, all machines are selected.

After selecting the machine, provide the absolute file path to the file you want to download.
For example: `/home/tigergraph/tigergraph/data/files/v.csv`.

Make sure the provided file path is allowed by the xref:tigergraph-server:security:file-output-policy.adoc[GSQL file output policy].
When a file path is not allowed by the policy, you will not be able to preview or download the file.

=== Preview and download file

Once you provide a valid file path, you will be able to preview and download the file.
