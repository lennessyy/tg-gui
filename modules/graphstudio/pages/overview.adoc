= Overview

TigerGraph GraphStudioâ„¢ is an intuitive, browser-based interface for graph-based application development tasks.

== Feature Overview

image:graphstudio-main-page.png[]

GraphStudio provides the following features:

=== xref:design-schema.adoc[]
The *Design Schema* page is where users edit their graph schema.
Users are able to add and edit the attributes and fields of every vertex and edge they add to the schema.

=== xref:map-data-to-graph.adoc[]
The *Map Data To Graph* page is where users add data from external files and map it to the corresponding vertices or edges in the schema.

=== xref:load-data.adoc[]
The *Load Data* page is where users load their data from their data source to the database as specified in the mapping stage.

=== xref:explore-graph/README.adoc[]
The *Explore Graph* page is where users can explore their graph data and uncover insights based on their data.
Here users can search for vertices in a graph, discover nearby vertices, find paths between vertices, and run GSQL queries.
Users will also be able to use the *Graph Exploration* panel on this page to modify and augment the visualization of their exploration results.

=== xref:build-graph-patterns/visual-query-builder-overview.adoc[]
The *Build Graph Patterns* page is where users can build graph queries visually with a drag-and-drop interface.
In this way, users will not need to understand any GSQL to build queries, run queries, or evaluate results.

=== xref:write-queries.adoc[]
The *Write Queries* page is where users can write and test out custom GSQL queries using a text-based query editor.
The query editor validates the user's query syntax and notifies the user of any errors.

== GraphStudio Online Test Drive

Visit TigerGraph Test Drive demos at:
link:https://testdrive.tigergraph.com[https://testdrive.tigergraph.com/]

The GraphStudio online Test Drive features several instances of the
TigerGraph system, each one targeting a different use case. Each copy of
TigerGraph has a GraphStudio interface and is preloaded with
application-specific queries and synthetic data. These demo applications
are provided in a read-only mode. Users can explore and play with
pre-installed queries. Users on these demo systems cannot save changes
to the graph schema, the loading job, or queries.


== GraphStudio Availability

=== Cloud

If you are using GraphStudio in the TigerGraph Cloud environment, you can directly access GraphStudio via your browser.

=== On-Premises
For on-premises deployment, the server by default is listening on port 14240.
Any machine connected to the server can access GraphStudio from a browser with the following address:

[source,http]
----
http://<your_tigergraph_server_ip_address>:<your_tigergraph_server_port>
----

If you cannot access GraphStudio, check your firewall to ensure that port 14240 is open.

If you see the error message "Oops, looks like something went wrong" on the login page, the GUI service might be off.

To verify the status of the GUI service, run the following command in a Linux shell on the server.

 $ gadmin status gui

If it is off, turn it on by running:

[source,console]
----
$ gadmin start gui
----

CAUTION: This error might also be caused by an IP range block rule from your ad blocker.
Please try turning off your ad blocker for the GraphStudio page and try again. GraphStudio does not have any ads.

== User menu

The User icon image:account_btn.png[image] in the upper-right corner opens a menu with GUI customization options and links to these documentation pages.

GraphStudio supports English, Simplified Chinese, and Japanese user interface language options.

== GraphStudio Session Timeout

GraphStudio has a default session timeout of 1 week. If, during this
time, the user has no interaction with the page, the session will expire
and the user will be logged out automatically. The timeout can be
configured with this server command:

[source,bash]
----
$ gadmin config set GUI.ClientIdleTimeSec [timeout]
----
