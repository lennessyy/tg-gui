:experimental:

OpenCypher is a popular graph query language.
Starting from TigerGraph v3.9, TigerGraph support most OpenCypher syntax, within the GSQL environment.

This allows users who are familiar with openCypher to get started querying TigerGraph quickly and easily.

On this page, we will go through the steps of writing openCypher queries in both GraphStudio and GSQL Web Shell.

. Write your openCypher query in the query editor.
+
.initial openCypher query template
[,console]
----
CREATE DISTRIBUTED OPENCYPHER QUERY query_name() FOR GRAPH graph_name {
// Insert your openCypher code here
}
----
+
.Example
[,console]
----
CREATE DISTRIBUTED OPENCYPHER QUERY get_user_by_id() FOR GRAPH communication_mau {
  MATCH (u:user)
  WHERE u.id = "test"
  RETURN u
}
----
. Click “Save query draft”.

. Now run your query as your would for standard GSQL queries.
.. If you want to run your query in interpreted mode, click "Run Query".
.. If you want to install the query first for higher performance, click “Install Query”, wait for the installation to finish, then click "Run Query".
