= Export And Import Solution
:experimental:

== Export and Import

These two features can be found on the GraphStudio Home page.

[WARNING]
====
Legacy solutions exported prior to v3.1 cannot be imported into newer versions due to data storage changes made in v3.1.
Contact support@tigergraph.com for guidance to import an older solution.
====

=== Export

Click btn:[Export Current Solution] to download the whole solution as a tar file, including the schema, the loading jobs, and the queries.
The exported file also includes metadata that describes the layout of your schema design as well as user-created icons to preserve the design of your GraphStudio solution.

The tar file includes two folders: *graph/* and *gui/*. The *graph/* folder includes an `ExportedGraph.zip` file that contains the following files:

* `DBImportExport_<graphName>.gsql` command file for each graph called <graphName> in a MultiGraph system.
The command file creates the exported graph, including its local vertex, edge, and tuple types, along with its loading jobs, data source file objects and queries.
* `global.gsql` - Loading job to create all global vertex and edge types and data sources.
* `tuple.gsql` - Loading job to create all User Defined Tuples.

[NOTE]
====
This `ExportedGraph.zip` file is identical to what is produced by running the xref:3.8@tigergraph-server:import-export:database-import-export.adoc[database export command] with the template option.
====

The `gui/` folder contains all user icons and a json file that describes the layout of the schema in GraphStudio.

[WARNING]
====
. The graph data and data files will not be exported.
. If a query has been modified since it was last installed, GraphStudio will export the modified draft instead of the version installed in the TigerGraph engine.
. Starting with TigerGraph 3.0, GSQL queries can be run in Interpreted Mode in GraphStudio without installation. These queries need to be installed to be exported.
====

=== Import

Click btn:[Import an Existing Solution] to upload a previously exported tar file.

[NOTE]
====
In order to optimize the time required for import, the imported queries will not be installed but saved as drafts. You need to install them manually.
====

[WARNING]
====
Importing a solution will overwrite the current solution. The existing schema, loading jobs, queries and data files will be erased before the new solution is imported.
