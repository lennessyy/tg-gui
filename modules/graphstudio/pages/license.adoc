Without a valid license, it is not possible to navigate to the Design Schema, Map Data To Graph, Load Data, Explore Graph, Build Graph Patterns or Write Queries pages.

Please note that the GraphStudio item under Applications section needs to be lightened like above. If it looks like this grayed icon: image:graphstudio_disabled (1).png[], it means GraphStudio is not enabled in the provided license, and you won't be able to use GraphStudio in this case. You can upgrade your license to enable GraphStudio access, contact sales@tigergraph.com for more information.
